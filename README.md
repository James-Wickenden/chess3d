# chess3d

Creating a 3D chess program to learn openGL and dive back into working with C++.
https://github.com/James-Wickenden/chess3d

---

## Todo:

- Create low poly 3d chess models
- Parse model OBJs and MTLs into 3d space with openGL
- Add camera controls w tutorial help with mouse/arrow key movement
- Create the game logic for chess, based on building the incremental steps of a gameplay session:
	- Moving pieces
	- Finding all valid moves given a piece/board
	- Detecting check
	- Capturing pieces
	- Storing moves as notation
	- Advanced moves: en passant, castling
	- Detecting checkmate
- Undoing moves with a gamestate stack
- Adding a PGN to the game window
- Saving/loading games
- Sound effects!
- Playing w a bot by API?

## In progress:

- Create the game logic for chess, based on building the incremental steps of a gameplay session:
	- Board initiating
	- Pieces
	- Defining a board as a structure of pieces and empty squares

## Completed:
